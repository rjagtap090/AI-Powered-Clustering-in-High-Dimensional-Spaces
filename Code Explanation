1. Data Loading and Cleaning:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Clean the data by removing any missing values.

2. Feature Selection:
   - Select the relevant features for clustering.

3.Dimensionality Reduction:
   - Apply PCA to reduce the dataset to 2 principal components.
   - Apply t-SNE to reduce the dataset to 2 dimensions.

4.Clustering:
   - Perform K-Means clustering on the PCA-reduced data.
   - Perform DBSCAN clustering on the PCA-reduced data.

5. Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the clustering performance using silhouette scores and Davies-Bouldin scores.

6. Visualization:
   - Plot the clustering results for both PCA and t-SNE reduced data.
